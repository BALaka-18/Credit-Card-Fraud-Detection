# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card Frauds are very common. The focus is on detecting Financial fraud using Machine Learning.
This is a highly imbalanced dataset, thus we have applied under-sampling on the dataset.
A relationship was established between Fraud and Amount of money withdrawn. Time was removed as no relation was found from the plots.
Used Naive Bayes Classifier to train the model applicable on 4 case studies as illustrated in the notebook.

# Present Work : 
Implementing Logistic Regression and over-smapling using SMOTE to increase accuracy.
